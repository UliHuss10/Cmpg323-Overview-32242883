## 3.Branching Strategy

After each project is done it is pushed to the main repo. Each project contains a versions that need to be done and checked before it can be pushed to the main branch.Each project must be merged with the previous project that has been completed . I'm using the gitflow branching strategy because it is more user friendly and can easily be interpreted by the reader and user.

## 4..Gitignore file within each project
Im using .Gitignore for all of the projects.The .gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of my repo.The purpose of this .gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by git remain untracked.

## 5.Storage of credentials and sensitive information
